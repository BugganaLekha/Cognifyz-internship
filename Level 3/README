Level 3
 
 Task 1: Predictive Modeling
   Build a regression model to predict the
   aggregate rating of a restaurant based on
   available features.
   Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   and evaluate the models performance using
   appropriate metrics.
   Experiment with different algorithms (e.g.,
   linear regression, decision trees, random
   forest) and compare their performance.

 Task 2: Customer Preference Analysis
   Analyze the relationship between the type of
   cuisine and the restaurants rating.
   Identify the most popular cuisines among
   customers based on the number of votes.
   Determine if there are any specific cuisines
   that tend to receive higher ratings.

 Task 3: Data Visualization
   Create visualizations to represent the distribution
   of ratings using different charts (histogram, bar
   plot, etc.).
   Compare the average ratings of different cuisines
   or cities using appropriate visualizations.
   Visualize the relationship between various
   features and the target variable to gain insights.
